# Weather-1
This weather app provides users with real-time weather updates, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, for any location worldwide. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app fetches data from a public weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI) to display current weather information.
